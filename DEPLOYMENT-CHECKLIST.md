- [ ] Assignment ready for grading

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check Node.js version and dependencies
- **Environment variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
- **CORS errors**: Verify frontend URL in backend CORS config
- **Database connection**: Check MongoDB Atlas network access
- **Deployment failures**: Review GitHub Actions logs

### Getting Help
- Check the deployment logs in your hosting platform
- Review GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Test endpoints locally before deploying
- Verify environment variables are correct
